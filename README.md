Some helper functions to read and analyze zoom attendance and Q&A reports in Python

*Note: These helped me with a specific analysis, but this repo does not aim to be a general library. Check all output carefully if you decide to use this code on your own data! Bug fixes and PRs welcome, license is MIT. *

Currently supported:
- Reading "performance reports" and plotting attendance over sessions
- Reading "poll reports" and plotting the response counts/proportions
